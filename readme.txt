This game is a single player game. The goal of the game is to collect keys, while avoiding hazards while jump down platforms(figure1). The player must not go past the viewport’s top and bottom boundary, or the game will be over.

A video demo is available on the github page. '2D platformer Video Trailer.mp4'
Detailed documentation on the game is availalble as well. 'Prototype Design and Specification.pdf'
